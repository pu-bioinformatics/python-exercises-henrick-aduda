# python-exercises

For each of the exercises in in the Jupyter Notebooks, you are required to create a Python Script, approriately named and stored in the right directory. Take note that you will be graded on:
- how you organize your directories
- How well you document your code and repo
- How you use Git and GitHub (informative commit message, etc)
- And the correctness of your scripts


Work through all the exercises to notebook 6

## python-exercises-Henrick Aduda(notebook 01-06)

Please find the scripts for each exercise on the src folder. There are comments at the begining of each script showing the module number and the thought process of my codes. The folders are named chronologically according to the module exercise number i worked on. I enjoyed working through the exercise and i learnt a lot. Thanks.
