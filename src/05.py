#Module 5. This is my first while loop with numbers from 0 to 5 printed out
x=0
while x<6:
    print("This is the value of x=", x)
    x=x+1
print ("Done")

#Question2
while x<11:
    
    print("This is the value of x=", x)
    x=x+1
print ("Done")

#Question3
x=list(range(1,11))
print(x)
for i in x:
    if i>=4:
        print("This is the value of x=",i)
